A utility to add tags from a booru to image files.

Uses XMP Dublin Core tags, which Windows is natively capable of reading from JPEG files.
With the installation of this [dll](https://gitgud.io/nvtelen/xmp_property_extension), 
reading support is added for PNG, GIF and JXL files. 

## Usage
Make sure config.toml is in the same folder as the executable.

Add your accouts' API access credentials to the configuration file's api url values if desired.

Additional boorus can be added provided the correct values are added to the configuration file.
